# Expolatory-Data-Analysis-on-Ames-Housing-Dataset

## Introduction & background:

The major goal of this project was to identify the key factors impacting
the sale price of residential property in Ames, Iowa. The Ames Housing
dataset was investigated to attain this crucial goal. The Ames Housing
dataset was created by Dean De Cock of Truman University after being
collected by the Ames City Assessor's Office. Kaggle was utilised to get
the compiled version of the Ames Housing dataset used in this study.

The Ames Housing dataset contains 80 variables relating to residential
properties sold in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010, including the sale
price (SalePrice) and 79 explanatory variables characterising the homes'
features. A detailed description of the variables in this dataset can be
obtained on Kaggle.

## Problem Identification:

### **Problem 1 -** Which is the impact of the neighborhood selection on the final price?

This problem will give real estate brokers a general picture of the
impact of the area on the sale price and, as a result, match consumer
expectations.

### **Problem 2 - How the price and number of sales evolved from 2006 to 2010?**

The answers to this question will tell real estate professionals about
the price and number of sales trends over the study period.

### **Problem 3 - What would be the best season to buy a house?**

Prices and demand are sometimes changed by seasons, which is an
important factor to recognise in order to assist our customers in
determining the best time to purchase a home.

### **Problem 4 - What is the remodeling impact on the market price?**

Our major purpose is to help our customers, and knowing the influence of
remodelling on price, real estate agents may advise if it is preferable
to remodel the house or sell it as is.

### **Problem 5 - How much value will another room bring?**

Answering this question will assist real estate professionals in
determining how much a room will contribute to the price of a house,
whether selling or purchasing.

### **Problem 6 - What are the most highly correlated variables that best predict the sale price?**

Understanding the feature corelation will assist us in determining the
best predictor for our model.

### **Problem 7 - Fit a linear model that accurately predicts the sale prices.**

Fitting an accurate model can assist real estate agents in estimating
consumer sale prices based on a few essential factors.
